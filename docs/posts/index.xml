      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been running a Helix keyboard as my daily driver for the last year and have been loving it so far, unfortunately for the last couple of months I&amp;rsquo;ve had a bootloader issue that mean&amp;rsquo;t I could no longer flash the firmware and customise the keymap. A lot of the guidance wasn&amp;rsquo;t super useful on this but I managed to stumble my way into a solution which may help others in the same situation.</description>

      <description>This weekend I thought I would play with typescript and GRPC a little. It seems docs on getting this up and running is a bit thin on the ground, so that makes it perfect candidate for a little blog post.
You can find example code here
To get started we need to create project, do so with the following commands
1 2 3 4  mkdir grpc-project yarn init mkdir -p src/proto yarn add typescript ts-node grpc grpc-tools ts-protoc-gen @grpc/proto-loader   now we will want to create a protoc service so we can do some tasty code generation, here is an example proto file to get started</description>

      <title>Deploying Hugo with Travis CI</title>

      <description>This blog is built with Hugo, and I wanted a simple way to build and then deploy it with Ansible. To do this I used Travis CI, this is relatively simple, but isn&amp;rsquo;t documented very well. So Here I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how I did it.
First up, you want a Hugo site, get started here. One simple thing that may immediately break in Travis is themes as submodules. Travis can&amp;rsquo;t deal with ssh submodules, so check your .</description>

      <title>Arduino Volume Meter</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently upgraded to a Audio Technica AT2020 so I can use better headphones on my home computer. Having a freestanding microphone does have its difficulties though. Keeping track of how loud I am coming through to friends is hard when I can move away from the microphone. To solve this I built an Arduino volume meter. Here I&amp;rsquo;ll go over how it works.
I wanted an excuse to write some rust and the availablity of the winapi crate seemed like a good opportunity to give it go.</description>
